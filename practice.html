    <h1 id="top">My coding journey</h1>
    <p id=first>
        My coding journey began in early 2016 when I was first introducted to Launch Code & I began studying in the CS50 program. I had no idea what I was in for, but I was happy to be there! I made friends, had study partners and things were going well even though this course was <em>VERY</em> difficult! We were all there to learn, well, most of of us anyway.

            Things were going well, I was featured in an article in EQ Magazine and got to learn CS50 directly from the people who teach it as the CS50 Hackathon!

                Unfortunately, I stopped coding completely and was no longer learning. I felt with tons of dissappointment because I couldn't follow through as my classmates did.  After moving beyond all of that, I am NOW thrilled to be in Code Camp 2019 & I couldn't be happier about it!
